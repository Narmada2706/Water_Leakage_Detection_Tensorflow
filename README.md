
## Leakage Detection Using Tensorflow

## What is Tensorflow:

The TensorFlow object detection API is the framework for creating a deep learning network that solves object detection problems. 
There are already pre-trained models in their framework which they refer to as Model Zoo. 
This includes a collection of pre-trained models trained on the COCO dataset, the KITTI dataset, and the Open Images Dataset.

## What is Keras:

Neural network library
Keras is an open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks.
 Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library.

 ## What is Neural Network:

 A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavours to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. Neural networks can adapt to changing input
 so the network generates the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria.

 ## What is CNN in deep learning:

 In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN/ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery. Now when we think of a neural network we think about matrix multiplications but that is not the case with ConvNet. It uses a special technique called Convolution. 
Now in mathematics convolution is a mathematical operation on two functions that produces a third function that expresses how the shape of one is modified by the other.

## What is object Detection in Deep Learning:

Deep learning-based object detection method has the ability to extract the feature automatically with help of deep learning algorithms such as Convolution Neural Network, 
Auto-Encoder, Variance Auto-Encoder etc.
 which is generate the feature from the image like edge, shape etc.

 ## What is SSD:

 Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) is an object detection algorithm that is a modification of the VGG16 architecture. 
SSDâ€™s architecture builds on the venerable VGG-16 architecture but discards the fully connected layers.

## purpose of This Project

To prevent serious damage from being done through faulty pipes. It is essential to detect leakage before disaster hits.
